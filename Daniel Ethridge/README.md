# Daniel Ethridge (Brain Music Lab 2023 - Present)
Originally from Atlanta, Georgia, Daniel is a multi-faceted musician, sound engineer, and software engineer whose interests lie at the intersection of music, physiology, and technology. As a first year PhD student, he is excited to explore the ways in which technology can employ human physiological signals as inputs into interactive, musical experiences. Daniel received a B.A. in mathematics and music from Brevard College in Brevard, North Carolina and later an M.S. in Music Technology from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. He is currently advised by Dr. Grace Leslie, professor of music and director of the Brain Music Lab at the ATLAS Institute.
