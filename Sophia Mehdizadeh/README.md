# Sophia Mehdizadeh (Brain Music Lab 2020 - Present)
Sophia is an ATLAS PhD student working at the intersection of music, cognitive science, and human-centered design. Her research focuses on psychophysiological correlates of musical preference and connection, and mechanisms of musically induced emotion. She is also passionate about building music performance systems, and exploring how her research may lead to novel mappings between physiological signals and musical expression. She has a B.S. in electrical engineering with a minor in music from the University of Michigan and an M.S. in music technology from Georgia Tech. Sophia is advised by Dr. Grace Leslie, professor of music and director of the Brain Music Lab at the ATLAS Institute.
